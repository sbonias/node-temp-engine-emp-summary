## Description

This is a software engineering team generator command line application. The application initially prompts the user for information about the team member being added in terms of their role: Manager, Engineer, or Intern. This is followed by the user being prompted with targeted questions: name, employee id, email. After this, additional questions are made based on the employee's role: engineer - github user name, manager - office number, intern - school you are currently attending. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers, manager and interns. When the user has completed building their team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
